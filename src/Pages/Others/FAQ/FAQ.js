          <p className="text-3xl font-semibold text-red-500">Will you make us earn?</p>
          <p>
            No. We Don't. We will not make you earn, but we can make you capable
            of earning. Earning will depend entirely on your subject-specific
            knowledge, skills, and qualifications. We will help you with
            training and proper guidance on specific courses, related
            marketplaces, and how to get jobs in the marketplace. You have to
            make your earning journey smooth by sharpening your skills through
            time, effort, and patience. And how much you earn will depend on how
            much effort and time you put into your job. And remember one thing;
            freelancing is not the only option for earning money. You can also
            earn by hunting local clients, doing remote jobs, or running your
            own business.

            How do you conduct online classes? Do you only provide recorded
            classes?
          </p>
          <p>
            We conduct live classes in online courses via Zoom. We only provide
            important class records so that our students can watch the videos
            again and again until they understand the topic thoroughly. In
            addition, we also provide backup support in case any problem arises
            further.

            Can I work on online marketplaces only by taking courses at CIT?
          </p>
          <p>
            After completing a course you can work as a freelancer in the online
            market as well as get the opportunity in the local marketplace. At
            the end of the course we refer our students to various companies
            through our Career Placement Department. If you attend classes
            regularly, and complete the course by taking all the projects and
            exams, then you have a great chance of getting a well-paid job.

            What are the benefits of the offline course? Do you provide extra
            facilities?
          </p>
          <p>
            By taking an offline course you learn on campus and get the
            opportunity to interact better with the mentors. Besides, you can
            use our practice lab to complete the given tasks offline. Our extra
            facilities include 24/7 online support, discussion classes, backup
            support for the students, internship opportunities and career
            placement facilities. We ensure your best learning experience in
            your journey with CIT and push you ahead in your career path.

            How to pay the course fee? Is it in one go or installments are
            available?
          </p>
          <p>
            It's your choice. You can either pay the entire course fee in one go
            or in 4 installments at intervals of 25-30 days. The number of
            Installments will vary in your course duration.

            Will you guarantee a job at the end of the course?

            How long will it take to become an expert?
          </p>
          <p>
            Expertise depends on your hard work and the way you approach a
            profession. To be successful you need to have a proper plan with the
            right mindset. Moreover, everyone has a different learning pace
            which makes it difficult to say how much time you will take to
            improve. If you maintain consistency and try to develop every day,
            you will notice the improvement yourself within a short period of
            time.
